## Structure optimisation # LH: BT feedback - Want to capture more details on parameters applied for calculations. E.g. for periodic DFT - K-point grid / energy cutoff etc. IS: I'd agree, and ideally I'd like to be able to capture gas phase vs periodic DFT methods. DMACRYS based methods use gas-phase DFT coupled with dispersion FF for lattice, which is har to capture with this. LH: BT feedback - Want to capture single point energies. Unable to in this format. IJS: borrowing from TCOD, I think criteria for stopping the minimisation should be considered

## Structural properties metadata # LH: How do we capture multiple energies for a single structure? E.g. Lattice energies calculated at multiple levels of theory. IJS: prinicpal use case would be PBE minimised structure, with single point PBE0 calc (GRACE approach). I'd imagine people would just use the PBE0 energy in that case, but would be nice to include PBE energy if possible

* Simulation type - Indication of how the crystal modelling handles thermal effects (static: does not include thermal corrections of the lattice energy, or dynamic: includes thermal corrections of the lattice energy)
* Density - Density value calculated from the predicted crystal cell and contents.
* Temperature - The temperature at which the structure is calculated.
* Pressure - The pressure at which the structure is calculated.
* Conformer identifier - External identifier or label of a conformer used in a CSP calculation  # LH notes this wasn't used by submitters. Can see niche use caes, but is definitely an option.
* Absolute energy - The total (absolute) energy of the crystal structure, with respect to gas-phase atoms.

## Lattice energy

* Relative - The relative lattice energy of the structure with respect to the global minimum on the lattice or absolute energy landscape.
* Absolute - Lattice energy, with respect to isolated gas-phase molecules in their lowest energy conformation
* Rank - The rank of the structure when ordered by e.g. increasing relative energy where 1 indicates the lowest energy structure
* Error - Estimate of the assigned absolute lattice energy error evaluated as (predicted - experiment)
* Relative error - Estimate of the assigned relative lattice energy error defined as ((predicted - experimental)/experimental) and given as a simple ratio (not a percentage)

## Free energy

* Absolute - The free energy correction of the total (absolute) energy at a given temperature
* Correction energy - The free energy correction of the lattice energy at a given temperature
* Relative - The relative free energy, at a given temperature, of the structure with respect to the corresponding global minimum on the same free energy landscape
