# Sharing Your Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) Methods

We welcome contributions of Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) methods to our database. To ensure consistency and
usability, please follow these guidelines when submitting your data. Your cooperation will help us build a comprehensive
and reliable resource for the community and improve the current dictionary.

## Methodology

Provide a clear description of the computational method used to generate theoretical structures. This
includes the structure generation method, the energy evaluation steps (e.g., DFT, DFTB, force fields), and any specific
parameters or corrections (e.g., dispersion corrections) employed. If a peer-reviewed publication describes your method,
please provide a full citation and link. This allows us to accurately document your methodology using the standardized
CSP dictionary, and to fill in any missing data fields. A few output structures can be submitted for demonstration 
purposes, but this is **not** a requirement.

We kindly request that you submit a single, representative method for each unique CSP approach.
This helps us avoid redundancy. The method data should be publicly accessible and free of any private or
company-protected files. We cannot accept submissions that are not published in a permanent, open-access repository or
similar location.

Submission files should be in a folder named after the PI, university or company and include:

* Contact details (name and email)
* Method description and/or related publication
* (Optional) A few output structures

Files can be shared by either creating a pull request of the GitHub Repo or writing to _nfrancia@ccdc.cam.ac.uk_. In 
this case, please specify if you want your method to be included in the SharedMethod folder as an example.

## Data Curation

Upon submission, we will use our standardized CSP dictionary to describe your methodology and the output
structures. We will check the provided data for consistency and completeness, and will work with you to correct or add
any data fields that are crucial for a full and accurate description of your work. This collaborative process ensures
that all submitted data is well-documented and easily comparable with other methods.
