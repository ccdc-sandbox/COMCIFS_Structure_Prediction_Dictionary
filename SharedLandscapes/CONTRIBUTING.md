# Sharing Your Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) Landscapes

We welcome contributions of Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) landscapes to our database. To ensure consistency and
usability, please follow these guidelines when submitting your data. Your cooperation will help us build a comprehensive
and reliable resource for the community and improve the current dictionary.

## Methodology 

Provide a clear and detailed description of the computational method used to generate the landscape. This
includes the structure generation method, the energy evaluation steps (e.g., DFT, DFTB, force fields), and any specific
parameters or corrections (e.g., dispersion corrections) employed. If a peer-reviewed publication describes your method,
please provide a full citation and link. This allows us to accurately document your methodology using the standardized
CSP dictionary, and to fill in any missing data fields.

## Landscape Submission 

We kindly request that you submit a single, representative landscape for each unique CSP method.
This helps us avoid redundancy. The landscape data should be publicly
accessible and free of any private or company-protected files. We cannot accept submissions that are not published in a
permanent, open-access repository or similar location. 

## Data Curation 

Upon submission, we will use our standardized CSP dictionary to describe your methodology and the output
structures. We will check the provided data for consistency and completeness, and will work with you to correct or add
any data fields that are crucial for a full and accurate description of your work. This collaborative process ensures
that all submitted data is well-documented and easily comparable with other landscapes in our database.
